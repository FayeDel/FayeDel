### Heya ðŸ‘‹

My name's Delta, nice to meet you reader :)
I currently specialise in backend development but I'm not afraid to do front-end development! (I'll admit, I'm just all over the place with development, though I just like coding in different languages and learning/trying new things) :)

Outside of development, I mainly either relax or do other things with a cup of tea :)
(Currently in uni, so my github activity isn't consistent sadly, I would definitely contribute and PR more projects if I wasn't in a weird schedule.)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently relearning JS/TS, and maybe next.js ðŸ‘€
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently either working on my bot (private at the moment) or developing [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/library) :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her  <!-- I'd really appreciate if you respect my pronouns :) -->
