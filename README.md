### Hiii ðŸ‘‹

I'm Faye, nice to meet you reader ðŸ’– (You can also call me Delta though, I'm fine with either~)

I currently specialise in backend and CI/CD, but I'm willing to do other types and experiment when the situation needs for it!
Outside of development though, I do have a lot more hobbies, including fashion designing and singing... though I'm just embarrassed to showcase those.... yeaaaa shhhh :p

(I know my GH activity is like empty lately, I'm just burnt out of coding until who knows when.... one day I guess :p)

- ðŸŒ± Current development goals... I dunno. Getting a remote job with it would be nice though, if not trying to get a passion project again.
- ðŸ”­ Just IRL stuff including classes-based coding and stuff I guess. Mostly just IRL stuff though, but I still hope to come back to GH to contribute code again though-
- ðŸ’¬ You can still ask me about Discord related topics though! I'll try my best to respond :P
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her 
- ðŸ‘€ I also know that my site isn't up to date either... moreover domain name wise I dunno either its too expensive-
