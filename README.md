### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Faye, nice to meet you reader ðŸ’– <!-- (You can also call me Delta though, I'm fine with either~) -->

I currently specialise in backend, CI/CD and devops, but I'm willing to do other types and experiment when the situation needs for it!
Outside of development though, I do have a lot more hobbies, including fashion designing and singing... though I'm just embarrassed to showcase those... soonTM I guess :P


- ðŸŒ± Current development goals... I dunno. Getting a remote job with it would be nice though, if not trying to get a passion project again.
- ðŸ”­ My GH activity's pretty much empty because of classwork for the most part. Might come back after... but I don't know yet. 
- ðŸ’¬ You can still ask me about Discord related topics though! I'll try my best to respond :P
- ðŸ‘€ I also know that my site isn't super up to date either (besides portfolio)... moreover domain name wise I dunno either its too expensive-
