### Heya ðŸ‘‹

My name's Delta, and I do a lot of things, in a coding world I sortof** am a loose full-stack dev but my experience heavily leans over back-end things (but front-end is fun too!)

(Sort of aka not really, I just like coding in different languages and learning/trying new things) :)

Outside of that, I play video games/sports/listen to music while drinking tea and/or energy drinks for the most part. (Currently in uni, so my github activity isn't consistent sadly, I would definitely contribute and PR more things if I wasn't in a weird schedule.)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a really bulky project that aims to help users and helping a popular library (in terms of commits/main focus) :)
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything related to Discord, from bot development to API/WS and anything in between. I'm happy to assist however I can.
