### Hihii ðŸ‘‹

My name's Delta, nice to meet you reader ðŸ’–
I currently specialise in backend and CI/CD development but I'm not afraid to do front-end development! (I'll admit, I'm just all over the place with development, though I just like coding in different languages and learning/trying new things) :)

Outside of development, I... admit I have a ton of other hobbies (balancing is hard okay-)

(My github activity isn't consistent sadly, I would definitely contribute and PR more projects if I wasn't in a weird schedule but I do try to work on it)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ll plan to learn rust or zig.. I guess? I'm not 100% sure of my current dev goals ðŸ‘€
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently just doing IRL stuff (including IRL coding atm) for the time being. I do hope to come back to GH to contribute code again though-
- ðŸ’¬ You can still ask me about Discord related topics though! I'll try my best to respond :P
